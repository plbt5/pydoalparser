# pyDoal
Python-based parser for EDOAL: Expressive and Declarative Ontology Alignment Language. For the specifications of EDOAL, refer to http://alignapi.gforge.inria.fr/edoal.html, or my shorthand BNF Entity Expression (see the sources).

Indeed, at the same url, more EDOAL tools are available. However, only in java and I preferred a python implementation. Since I didn't want to explore the java-python binding approach of, e.g., Jython, and I wanted to get a profound understanding of the EDOAL language, implementing my own EDOAL parser in python seemed the most appropriate way to go. Putting the code into open source it enables you to make use of it or adopt the code when you deem necessary. 

This project is supported with test-cases and examples in order to get started. Still, Inria's original language specification and implementation remain a valuable source of information. 

Do not hesitate to get in contact with me.
